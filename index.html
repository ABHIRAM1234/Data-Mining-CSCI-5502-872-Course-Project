            <h1>Fire in Focus: A Machine and Deep Learning Approach to Analyzing Wildfires</h1>
            <h2>The Nature of the topic</h2>
            <p>Wildfires are natural disasters that occur in regions experiencing extreme heat and dry conditions, significantly impacting both human society and the 
                environment. This project focuses on collecting and analyzing wildfire data from the United States to predict future occurrences. Our insights have led 
                us to understand that wildfires pose a serious threat, making it crucial for people to be prepared for potential dangers. This understanding serves as 
                the backbone of our project. We aim to develop a predictive analysis to ensure that we are prepared to face any potential risks. Our goal is to leverage wildfire 
                data to develop a predictive model that forecasts when and where wildfires are likely to occur and spread in the United States. This will ensure that hospitalization
                facilities are available when needed. In the long term, it could save lives by reducing the impact of future wildfire events.</p>

            </div>
            <h2>Why Wildfire Analysis is Important?</h2>
            <p>The main goal of this project is to benefit the people of the USA from wildfire threats. Wildfires are a serious concern due to their potential to cause 
                innocent deaths, highlighting the urgent need to develop a model for predicting future events. Ultimately, our project could reduce the number of lives 
                lost during wildfire incidents.
                Wildfires are increasingly common due to climate change. The diverse terrain and highly urbanized land in the USA make it particularly vulnerable. Wildfires are spreading across grasslands and vegetated areas, putting a significant amount of agricultural land at risk. This can lead to desertification, soil erosion, changes in water runoff, altered precipitation patterns, and reduced soil quality in affected regions.
                When nations destroy their flora, they miss out on economic opportunities. Furthermore, wildfires alter landscapes and destroy natural attractions. This project has the potential to serve as a model for all countries facing similar challenges.
                Finally, this project is also focused on safeguarding the environment. We aim to prevent wildfires from destroying vast areas of land. Wildfires not only devastate vegetation but also harm wildlife, thereby threatening biodiversity. The fire-prone areas in the USA serve as habitats for various species, and losing these habitats could significantly impact our ecosystem.

            <h2>Who is Affected?</h2>
            <p>Wildfires are catastrophic events that impact people and communities, leaving a long lasting impact on landscape and society. Residents in fire-prone 
                areas are affected the most and often live near wildlands, where the risk of wildfire is significantly high. When a wildfire occurs, these people face 
                immediate danger to their lives, and property. Beyond the physical threat they endure the psychological toll of loss of property, evacuation and 
                uncertainty. The destruction of homes and loss of personal belongings lead to a great sense of loss and trauma. Many families require physical 
                rebuilding and emotional healing as they deal with the trauma of the experience. In such emergencies, firefighters and emergency personnel play a 
                critical role but face high risks from wildfires. These individuals put their lives at risk to protect people and nature from the destructive fire. 
                The physical and mental strain of battling wildfires can be immense, leading to burnout, exhaustion, and in some cases, post-traumatic stress disorder 
                (PTSD). Firefighters often work long hours in hazardous conditions, facing extreme heat and unpredictable fire behavior. Their efforts are crucial and 
                often lack sufficient resources and support, which can hinder their ability to respond effectively to fires. The psychological impact of witnessing 
                destruction and loss can also affect their well-being so it is important to create support systems for those at the frontline.

                <p>
                    During and after a wildfire, local and state governments bear responsibility for resource allocation and ensuring public safety. These authorities must take critical
                     decisions about evacuations, resource deployment, and maintain clear communication with the public. Firefighting efforts pose a financial burden and can strain
                      budgets, leading to tough choices about where to allocate funds in the wake of a disaster. Recovery efforts require long-term planning and investment in rebuilding
                       infrastructure, which can take years to achieve. Government agencies need to collaborate with various stakeholders, including organizations and environmental 
                       groups, to effectively manage recovery and restoration 
                    efforts

                    Wildfires do not just affect people and nature but also entire ecosystems and wildlife. Many species are displaced or killed in fire events, leading
                     to declines in biodiversity and disruptions in food chains. Studies about the Australia bushfire in January 2020 show that nearly 3 billion animals 
                     were killed or displaced.  Forests and grasslands that are crucial for carbon capture and the air quality may take years or decades to recover. The 
                     loss of vegetation can also lead to soil erosion and increased runoff, which can affect water quality in nearby streams and rivers. The long-term
                      ecological consequences of wildfires require a holistic approach to land management, considering human needs and also the health of the ecosystems 
                      that sustain us.

                    Industries such as real estate, agriculture, and tourism are significantly affected by wildfires. Farmers may lose crops and livestock, leading to
                     financial hardships and food supply disruptions. The tourism industry can suffer as natural attractions become inaccessible or damaged. This 
                     impacts local economies that rely on visitors. In areas where property values depend on how close they are to natural landscapes, wildfires can 
                     lead to a decline in real estate markets, as potential buyers become scared to invest in areas with fire risks. Wildfires create a ripple effect 
                     that extends far and wide, underscoring the necessity for effective risk mitigation and management strategies that address the diverse needs of all
                      affected stakeholders.

            <h2>What has been done so far and what are the gaps?</h2>
            <p>
                Wildfires have become increasingly prevalent and are causing environmental issues, further exacerbated by climate change and human activities. These 
                events pose immediate threats to life and property while also having long-term ecological impacts. Historically, wildfires have been a natural part of 
                many ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and habitat formation. However, the frequency and intensity of wildfires have risen exponentially in
                 recent years, bringing a need for improved prediction and management strategies. Recent advancements in technology and data analysis have provided new
                  tools to address these challenges, yet significant gaps remain in our understanding and response capabilities. In recent years, there has been 
                  substantial progress in wildfire prediction techniques. The integration of satellite imagery, remote sensing, and machine learning algorithms has
                   transformed the data collection and analysis. For example, NASA and other agencies have developed satellite systems that monitor vegetation moisture
                    levels, temperature, and wind patterns, which are key indicators of a risk of wildfire. These tools have helped researchers and fire management 
                    agencies to identify high-risk areas and assess the potential for fire ignition and spread more accurately than in the past. Predictive modeling, 
                    such as the use of Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) models, has enhanced the ability to forecast fire behavior under varying weather 
                    conditions.

                Despite these advancements, significant challenges remain in wildfire prediction and management. One of the primary challenges is the lack of real-time 
                data integration from multiple sources, such as social media, local reports, and environmental sensors. Current models mostly rely on historical data 
                which may not accurately reflect the changing climatic conditions or land use patterns. Many existing prediction models do not account for the 
                complexities of human behavior during fire events, such as evacuation patterns and decision-making processes. This can hinder effective communication 
                and coordination among emergency responders and the affected communities. Machine learning has promising solutions to address some of these challenges 
                in wildfire prediction and management. Advanced algorithms can analyze vast amounts of unstructured data from various sources, enabling real-time risk 
                assessments and adaptive management strategies. Deep learning models can process satellite images and remote sensing data to detect changes in land cover
                 and vegetation health, providing critical insights for fire risk assessment. However, the application of machine learning in this field needs to be
                  advanced, and there is a need for collaboration between data scientists, ecologists, and fire management professionals to develop models that can be
                   deployed in real-world scenarios.

                Fire spread modeling has also seen significant advancements, yet traditional fire spread models like FARSITE have limitations in terms of computational 
                efficiency. Recently there has been a focus on developing new models that can better capture the physical processes involved in fire spread while 
                remaining computationally efficient. For example, the U.S. Forest Service has been collaborating with Google Research on a new fire behavior model 
                that incorporates detailed fuel characteristics and can be run in real time using machine learning techniques to reduce computation times. Additionally, 
                cellular automata models have shown promise in simulating fire behavior, when combined with machine learning techniques to improve efficiency and 
                accuracy. As climate change continues to impact fire dynamics, ongoing research and collaboration will be essential for developing effective strategies
                 to mitigate the risks posed by wildfires. By focusing on these areas, we can lay the foundation for more resilient ecosystems and safer communities in 
                 the face of increasing wildfire threats.

                    so we binned the values into different ranges. Instances with confidence = l were dropped from the training set,
                     as they were likely misclassified due to sun glare or cloud reflection. Daytime fire pixels with low confidence are linked to sun glint and lower relative temperature anomalies (<15K)
                       in mid-infrared channel I4. Nominal confidence pixels are those without sun glint and with a temperature anomaly of >15K
                        in day or nighttime data. Fire pixels with high confidence are associated with day or nighttime saturation.</p>

                    our satellite data to only Southern California from 2020 and fetched the weather data for respective 
                    latitude and longitudes.</p>

                          where wildfires did not occur. To achieve a balanced
                           dataset, we quantified the positive class labels from 2020 to 2024 and subsequently conducted a random 
                           sampling of an equivalent number of data points from the unmatched dataset. This produced an equal
                            quantity of positive and negative class labels, with 56,948 instances for each. The data set comprises
                             a total of 113,896 rows.</div>
